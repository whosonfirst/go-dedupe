# go-dedupe

Go package for resolving duplicate "place" (or venue) locations.

## Documentation

Documentation, in particular the `godoc` documentation,  is incomplete at this time.

## Important

1. This code was written by and for the Who's On First project but many of the tools are data source (or provider) agnostic.
2. This package contains a number of different implementations for a variety of data and storage providers. This reflects the ongoing investigatory nature of the code. At some point in the future some of these implementations may be moved in their own packages or removed entirely.
3. None of this code is especially "fast". It preferences (relative) ease of use and reproducability in favour of speed and other optimizations. It can often hours, sometimes days, to process large datasets. Suggestions and gentle "clue bats" are welcome.

## Concepts

This code works around (1) common struct and (5) interfaces, and their provider-specific implementations. They are:

* [location.Location](location/README.md#locationlocation) – A Go language struct containing a normalized representation of a place or venue.

* [iterator.Iterator](iterator/README.md) – A Go language interface for iterating through arbirtrary database sources and emiting JSON-encoded GeoJSON records.
* [location.Parser](location/README.md#locationparser) – A Go language interface for parsing JSON-encoded GeoJSON records and producing `location.Location` instances.
* [location.Database](location/README.md#locationdatabase) – A Go language interface for storing and querying `location.Location` records.
* [embeddings.Embedder](embeddings/README.md) – A Go language interface for generating vector embeddings from input text.
* [vector.Database](vector/README.md) – A Go language interface for storing and querying vector embeddings.

The basic working model is as follows:

1. Given a data source or provider, iterate through its records generating and storing `location.Location` records.
2. Given two databases of `location.Location` records, one of them the "source" and the other the "target":
3. Derive the set of unique 5-character geohashes from the records in the "target" database.
4. For each of those geohashes, find all the `location.Location` records in the "source" database which a matching geohash and index each record in a vector database.
5. Store each matching ("source") `location.Location` record in a vector database deriving its embeddings using an `embeddings.Embedder` instance.
6. Query each of the ("target") records matching a given geohash against the records in the vector database; as with the records in the second database, embeddings for each record in the first database are derived using an `embeddings.Embedder` instance.
7. Matching records are emitted as CSV-encoded rows.

What happens with those CSV rows of matching records is left for implementors to decide. For a concrete example, have a look at the code in [app/locations/index](app/locations/index), [app/locations/compare](app/locations/compare) and the [compare](compare) package.

There are a few things to note about this approach:

* A 5-character geohash represents an area of approximately 2.4 km. In the future it may be the case that a longer geohash will be stored (in the location database) and a variable length geohash will be queried based on properties that can be derived about a location. For example, a venue in the center of Manhattan might use a longer, more precise geohash, versus a venue in a rural area might use a shorter, more inclusive, geohash.
* Likewise, if `location.Location` records have been supplemented with Who's On First hierarchies (on ingest or at runtime) then they might also be filtered by geohash _and_ region to account for the fact that the same geohash can span multiple administrative boundaries (for example `dr5re`).
* This code works best with small and short-lived (temporary) vector databases on disk or in memory. Storing and querying millions of venue records and their embeddings on consumer grade hardware (my laptop) is generally slow and impractical. Many (but not all, yet) of the `vector.Database` implementations have been configured with the ability to create (and remove) temporary databases automatically. Details are discussed in the [documentation for vector databases](vector/README.md).

As of this writing most of the work has been centered around the SQLite implementations for [location databases](location/README.md#sqldatabase) and [vector databases](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-dedupe/blob/main/vector/README.md#sqlitedatabase) and the Ollama implementation for [generating embeddings](embeddings/README.md#ollamaembedder). Details for each are discussed in their respective packages.

## Data sources (providers)

The following data source (providers) have working implementations (iterators and location parsers) for use with this package:

* [All The Places](https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/)
* [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/data-collection/museum-data-files) (Museum Data Files)
* [Overture Data](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/places/) (Places)
* [Who's On First](https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/?q=whosonfirst-data-venue&type=all&language=&sort=) (Venues)

## Example

Documentation and details for these tools can be found in the [cmd/README.md](cmd/README.md) file.

### Prune deprecated records

First, start by moving records flagged as deprecated in the `whosonfirst-data-deprecated-venue` repository. This isn't entirely necessary as the `whosonfirst://` iterator (below) defaults to excluding records which are marked as deprecated.

```
$> go run cmd/migrate-deprecated-records/main.go \
	-source-repo /usr/local/data/whosonfirst-data-venue-us-ny \
	-target-repo /usr/local/data/whosonfirst-data-deprecated-venue/
```

### Build locations database(s)

First create a locations database for all these Who's On First venues.

```
$> go run cmd/index-locations/main.go \
	-iterator-uri whosonfirst:// \
	-location-parser-uri whosonfirstvenues:// \
	-location-database-uri 'sql://sqlite3?dsn=/usr/local/data/whosonfirst-ny.db&max-conns=1' \
	/usr/local/data/whosonfirst-data-venue-us-ny/
```

Next create a locations database for Overture Data places, in this example venues with a confidence level of 0.95 or higher. For details on how to create a file like please consult the [documentation for the `whosonfirst/go-overture package.](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-overture?tab=readme-ov-file#exporting-overture-parquet-files-to-line-separated-json) 

```
$> go run cmd/index-locations/main.go \
	-iterator-uri overture:// \
	-location-parser-uri overtureplaces:// \
	-location-database-uri 'sql://sqlite3?dsn=/usr/local/data/overture-locations.db&max-conns=1' \
	/usr/local/data/overture/venues-0.95.geojsonl.bz2
```

### Compare records (against one another)

Now compare the Who's On First locations database against itself. This step is performed in order to deduplicate WOF records in the same database (repo).

```
$> go run cmd/compare-locations/main.go \
	-source-location-database-uri 'sql://sqlite3?dsn=/usr/local/data/whosonfirst-ny.db' \
	-target-location-database-uri 'sql://sqlite3?dsn=/usr/local/data/whosonfirst-ny.db' \
	-workers 50 \
	> /usr/local/data/wof-wof-ny.csv

...time passes

...and so on
```

The `/usr/local/data/wof-wof-ny.csv` file will look something like this:

```
$> tail -f /usr/local/data/wof-wof-ny.csv

... and so on
```

### Process (and deprecate) duplicate records

```
$> go run cmd/process-wof-duplicates/main.go \
	-reader-uri repo:///usr/local/data/whosonfirst-data-venue-us-ny \
	-writer-uri repo:///usr/local/data/whosonfirst-data-venue-us-ny \
	/usr/local/data/wof-wof-ny.csv
```

### Prune deprecated records (again)

Move newly deprecated records in the `whosonfirst-data-deprecated-venue` repository.

```
$> go run cmd/migrate-deprecated-records/main.go \
	-source-repo /usr/local/data/whosonfirst-data-venue-us-ny \
	-target-repo /usr/local/data/whosonfirst-data-deprecated-venue/
```

Rebuild the Who's On First location database:

```
$> go run cmd/index-locations/main.go \
	-iterator-uri whosonfirst:// \
	-location-parser-uri whosonfirstvenues:// \
	-location-database-uri 'sql://sqlite3?dsn=/usr/local/data/whosonfirst-ny-2.db' \
	/usr/local/data/whosonfirst-data-venue-us-ny/
```

### Compare Who's On First records against Overture records

```
$> go run cmd/compare-locations/main.go \
	-source-location-database-uri 'sql://sqlite3?dsn=/usr/local/data/overture-locations.db' \
	-target-location-database-uri 'sql://sqlite3?dsn=/usr/local/data/whosonfirst-ny-2.db' \
	-workers 50 \
	> /usr/local/data/overture/ovtr-wof-ny.csv

...time (a lot of it) passes

$> wc -l /usr/local/data/ovtr-wof-ny.csv 
   25538 /usr/local/data/ovtr-wof-ny.csv
```

### Apply concordances (between Who's On First venues and Overture places)

```
$> go run cmd/assign-wof-concordances/main.go \
	-reader-uri repo:///usr/local/data/whosonfirst-data-venue-us-ny \
	-writer-uri repo:///usr/local/data/whosonfirst-data-venue-us-ny \
	-concordance-namespace ovtr \
	-concordance-predicate id \
	/usr/local/data/ovtr-wof-ny.csv
```
